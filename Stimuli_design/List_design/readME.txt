Count_trials_fillers.rmd : making my life difficult: code to count the number of fillers before each NT trial before realising I can actually do that in excel.

Initial_list.xlsx : contains the basic 187 items we started from; items removed because of accent; no. of items/semantic  category; some items that were under discussion; a first attempt; a list of 41 items (22.11.022) that took us to the one we final used

MEGA_EXCEL_FILE.xlsx : the file based on which we created the experimental lists used in the picture naming task

Multipic_Exp.1.xlsx : includes the full list of images in Multipic together with different psycholinguistic variables; from those we compiled a list of items that we later used to reach the final pool of stimuli (45) (First_attempt)

POSimilarity_BigramFreq_BimTrans.rmd : initially used to get the Levenshtein and Aline distance for Spanish and English items for phonological and orthographic similarity; then added code to get figures on the bimanual transition and bigram frequency distributions of the final stimuli used in the experiment
