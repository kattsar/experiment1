euler.png : image of how the euler sequences are formed

euler.py : contains all functionality for generating sequences of stimuli; add this file to your working directory and import it using import euler to use the library --> from https://github.com/jbakermans/stimulus-history-euler-tours

extensions_euler.png : example of euler sequences and how they are extended

Re package R.zip : the file Ladislas shared with us; includes the original files randomisation.R and euler.py

Lists.rmd : copy-paste of Ladisla's code to try and create the sequences -- the code I worked with

Notes on code.R : me trying to understand Ladislas' code

questionnaire typing - English_tradAE.xlsx :

randomisation.R : Ladisla's code for pseudo-randomisation of the trials order in his task-switching paradigm

reticulate-1.pdf : Cheat-sheet on how to use Python with R with reticulate (the function 
required to create the sequences)

sequence.py : contains examples of generating sequences of stimuli for various experimental parameters; run it by calling python sequence.py on the command line --> from https://github.com/jbakermans/stimulus-history-euler-tours

test.csv : simple list of words I used when I was trying to create the sequences; realised we didn't need that for the actual sequence creation.
