1. Open shortcut folder 2023 on the Desktop.
2. Open folder SCRIPT_caja14032023.
3. Open subfolder caja.
4. Open the e-caja presentation file (first file below folder old).
5. Place the caja on top of the keyboard. Make sure the participant cannot see their hands but instruct the to place them on the keyboard on a way that  helps them type.
6. When on Presentation:
	- Press Run.
	- Insert participant ID and press ok.
	- The practice session and the main task run separately. On the new screen you will see on the left side the two different scenarios (practice 		and main task). Press Run Scenario to run the practice session.
	- When you see Ready on the screen, press ENTER.
	- After the participant has read the instructions, they need to press SPACE to begin. This point and the previous one you have to include in the 	instructions you give to the participant.
	- After the practice session has finished ask the participant to press SPACE. This will take you back to the screen with the scenarios. Press Run 		Scenario to run the main task.
	- At this point you exit the room, but remind the participant that they need to press Enter when they see Ready on the screen.
	- After the participant is done, they should not do anything in Presentation. After the main task is over, you will be redirected in the scenarios 		screen. Press Continue and then Finish/End (I am not sure about the word). Close the window.
