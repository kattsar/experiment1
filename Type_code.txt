Here's what each section does:

if len(keyResp.keys) > last_len: checks if any new keys have been pressed since the last time this code block was executed. It compares the length of keyResp.keys (the list of keys pressed) with last_len (the length of keys logged during the previous execution).

If new keys have been pressed, the code block inside the if statement is executed.

last_len = len(keyResp.keys) updates last_len to the current length of keyResp.keys, so it can be compared in the next iteration.

key_list.append(keyResp.keys.pop()) appends the last key pressed to key_list, removing it from keyResp.keys in the process. This ensures that each key press is logged only once.

if "backspace" in key_list: checks if the key "backspace" is present in key_list. This is used to handle the backspace key separately.

If "backspace" is found in key_list, key_list.remove("backspace") removes the "backspace" key from key_list.

if len(key_list) > 0: checks if there is at least one character in key_list after removing the backspace key.

If there is at least one character, key_list.pop() removes the last character from key_list. This ensures that the backspace key doesn't affect the logged keys, and it removes the last character typed when the backspace key is used.
